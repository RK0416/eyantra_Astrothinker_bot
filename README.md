eYRC 2023-24 introduces the captivating theme of "AstroTinker (AT) Bot". This theme revolves around a scenario where a robot is dispatched to a space station, divided into different modules, to rectify any problems that arise. Prompted by wireless alerts from the central hub, the robot navigates through the modules, swiftly locating faulty or missing components. It then communicates the issue to the central hub before heading to the electronics warehouse to perform the necessary repairs.
The core challenge of this theme lies in constructing the AstroTinker Bot from scratch, utilising an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) as its powerhouse. 
Through the FPGA's adept control over sensors and actuators, the robot adeptly traverses the arena, perceives its environment, and drag-drop essential components from the electronics warehouse. Wireless communication serves as the primary means for exchanging vital information with the central hub.
